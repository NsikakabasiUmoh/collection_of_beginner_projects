# Collection of beginner project

### Goal of Project
This is a collection of rock, paper and scissor, hangman, web scraping, number guessing etc. 
This collection is to help me start my programming process on GitHub, learn how to utilize git language properly 
and learn how to formally present any project on GitHub.

### Language Used
I chose python programming language, because I am proficient at it than C# at this moment.
I do plan to repeat most of the projects here with c#

### Problems Faced

# How to Install Python and Run the projects
First you have to [download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), 
then you have to choose an IDE for programming. 
I suggest [jetbrains pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)

# Purpose of Project
This collection of projects is for learning. 
I am trying to improve my git knowledge, 
you can use it to improve your python skills.
Feel free to fork this collection. Try out different ways to improve the code
and learn more of python (future plans to add C#).
